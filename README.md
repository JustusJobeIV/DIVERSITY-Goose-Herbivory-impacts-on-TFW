Herbivory by inhibits tidal freshwater wetland restoration success.

Long-term exclosure experiment conducted at Kingman freshwater tidal marsh restoration, Washington, DC. The long-term monitoring of this restoration site is ongoing but for this analysis data from the establishment of the study in 2009 to 2015.The study consists of 16 modules each containing a paired exclosure and control plot. 8 of the modules were 
established in vegetated regions of the marsh and 8 were established in unvegetated regions of the marsh. Vegetation monitoring occurred in both June and August of each year. 

The folder labelled raw data contains csv files of the data: 

NACE herbivory study 2009_2021 veg data 21jul21.csv <- vegetation data from June 2009 - June 2021. This data was subset in the code to only analyze data from 2009-2015 initially as managment activities changed in the restoration in 2016. 

NACE_ENV.csv <- Plot information utilized in the community composition analysis

The folder labelled code contains all R files for the analysis of the data: 

Percent Cover.R -> includes the statistical analysis of percent cover over the 6 year time period both for total cover and cover of annual plant species. 

Diversity.R -> includes the statistical analysis of species richness and Shannon-Wiener Index over the 6 year time period. 

NMDS.R -> includes the community composition analysis
